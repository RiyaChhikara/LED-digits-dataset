In this code, NMF is used to decompose grayscale images into their commonly occurring patterns. Firstly, the image dataset is explored and seen how it is encoded as an array. Here, 100 images are given as a 2D array samples, where each row represents a single 13x8 image. The images in the dataset are pictures of a LED digital display.
